#  CCTV Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based anomaly detection system to identify suspicious or abnormal activities captured in CCTV surveillance footage. The goal is to assist in real-time monitoring and safety enforcement by classifying frames from security videos into categories of anomalies such as abuse, arson, arrest, and assault.

---

##  Objective

To detect and classify abnormal human activities in CCTV footage using pretrained machine learning models. The system processes video data, extracts frames, and uses deep learning models for multi-class classification of anomalies.

##  How It Works

1. **Frame Extraction**  
   - Videos are read from multiple folders categorized by anomaly type.
   - Frames are extracted every few seconds and saved for training/testing.
   - Handles nested folders with video clips.

2. **Model Training**  
   - CNN-based models like ResNet50, DenseNet, and eXception are used.
   - Models are fine-tuned using transfer learning.
   - Input: extracted frames labeled by their source folder name.

3. **Prediction**  
   - Trained models are used to classify new video frames.
   - Predicts whether the frame is normal or an anomaly class.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score are used for performance evaluation.
